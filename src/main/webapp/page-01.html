            Why is it so goddamn hard to remember things?
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-03" class="bubble-03">
            Instead i've got everybody else feeding me crap about my past. Even though none of them were around when
            whatever it is what happenend to me .. actually happened!
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-04" class="bubble-04">
            The obvious part is i've 'changed'.-- But how?! And why? It's just a bunch of scattered images. I can't
            piece any of it together. And every time i close my eyes all i feel is pain.
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-05" class="bubble-05">
            I remember the pain then the light
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-06" class="bubble-06">
            Every night it was the same pain. Light. Cold. Darkness. Again and again until it finally woke me from my
            coma.
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-07" class="bubble-07">
            Maybe that's why i barely sleep at night. -- Maybe i wasn't supposed to wake up. Maybe i was supposed to
            stay where it's black.
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-08" class="bubble-08">
            Like the others.
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-09" class="bubble-09">
            Like someone burning a hole in the middle of me. A hole so big everything pours out of me.
        </div>
        <div id="bubble-10" class="bubble-10">
            Then it stops. And all i feel is the cold and heavy presence of darkness.
