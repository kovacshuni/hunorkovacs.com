            hard to<br/>

            Instead i've got everybody else feeding me crap about my past. Even though none of them were around when
            whatever it is what happenend to me .. actually happened!

        <div id="b-changed" class="B-changed">
            The obvious part is i've 'changed'.-- But how?! And why? It's just a bunch of scattered images. I can't
            piece any of it together. And every time i close my eyes all i feel is pain.
        </div>
        <div id="b-remember" class="B-remember">
            I remember the pain. Then...<br>
            The light.

            Then it stops.<br/>

        <div id="b-every-night" class="B-every-night">
            Every night it was the same pain. Light. Cold. Darkness. Again and again, until it finally woke me from my
            coma.
        </div>
        <div id="b-barely-sleep" class="B-barely-sleep">
            Maybe that's why i barely sleep at night. -- Maybe i wasn't supposed to wake up. Maybe i was supposed to
            stay where it's black.
        </div>
        <div id="b-like-others" class="B-like-others">
            Like the others.
