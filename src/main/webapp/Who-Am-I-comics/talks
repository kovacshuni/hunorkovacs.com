New York sped by on fast forward, dark rooftop water towers and a dead forest of antennas and
chimenys, all a blur.
It was shakedown time.

There is something disturbingly familiar in his records.
Written in all pretty curves:
He's in a graphic novel.
The truth split my skull open, a glaring green light washing the lines away.
All of his past was just fragmented still shots, words hanging in the air like balloons.
He was in a graphic novel.
Funny as hell, it was the most horrible thing i could think of.

You're in a computer game, H K!
Weapon statistics hanging in the air, glimpsed out of the corner of my eye. Endless repetition of the act of
shooting, time slowing down to show off my moves. The paranoid feel of someone controllin my every step.
I was in a computer game.
Funny as hell...

There was no glory in this.
I hadn't asked for this crap. Trouble had come to me, in big dark swarms.
The good and the just were like gold dust in the city. I had no illusions. I was not one of them--
I was no hero.
(Just me and the gun, and the crook)

The best in NYPD-DEA collaborative team--
good-hearted macho bullshit like that.
I would have given anything to have him here as my backup.
No such luck. No luck at all.

The Payne family. Happiness captured in a polaroid moment.
I had thought it would last forever.
"Till death od us part..."
I didn't want to think about it. As long as i didn't, it could never happen--

Michelle was working part-time in the district attorney's office.

The night groaned with cold. The garden lights flickered nervously. In their light the falling snow was dead white
before darkness ate it up.

This is what i see when i look back. These moments, blinding as snow, they kill you, change you,
you die and live again, remade.

In a nightmare, every choice you make is the wrong one.
