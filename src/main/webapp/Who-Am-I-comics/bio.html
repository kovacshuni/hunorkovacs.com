                            <p>I was born in 1989 in Miercurea Ciuc, Romania.</p>
                            <p>Went to college at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. Went for abroad studies for half a
                            year to Spain at the Carlos III University of Madrid.</p>
                            <p>I work as a software engineer mostly programming in Java.</p>
                            <p>I like to play a lot of sports. My dream is to travel the whole world.</p>

                            <p>The 1998 Pacific hurricane season was a moderately active Pacific hurricane season with seven
                                tropical cyclones directly affecting land. The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11,
                                which was about ten days later than the normal start of the season. The final storm of the
                                year, Hurricane Madeline (pictured), dissipated on October 20. Storm activity in the Central
                                Pacific Ocean was low, with just one tropical depression forming in the basin. Two tropical
                                cyclones from the Eastern Pacific, Darby and Estelle, also entered the central Pacific, with
                                the former entering as a hurricane.</p>
                            <p>The season produced 13 named storms, which was
                                slightly
                                below the average of 16 named storms per season. However, the total of nine hurricanes
                                during the season was equal to the average, and the total of six major hurricanes surpassed
                                the average.</p>
                            <p>The most notable tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Isis which
                                killed
                                fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California and coastal Sinaloa in
                                Mexico. Tropical Storm Javier also made landfall on Mexico and a tropical cyclone, Hurricane
                                Lester, affected Central America, causing two deaths in Guatemala.</p>
