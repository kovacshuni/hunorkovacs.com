This is a personal, minimalistic HTML website about me. It was built for being deployed to Google App Engine as a very basic Go app. There is no back-end logic nor database below, it's just a few static pages and redirects.

Contains an animated comic book, built only with HTML5, CSS3 and small JavaScript, that part looks art-like and cool :)
